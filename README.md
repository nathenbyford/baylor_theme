# Baylor reveal.js Theme for Quarto

This theme is heavily influenced by the [metropolis](https://github.com/pat-s/xaringan-metropolis) and [quarto-metropolis](https://codeberg.org/pat-s/quarto-metropolis) themes. With some color changes and the Baylor University logo in the corner.

## Edits made

-   Baylor green headings,
-   Baylor logo,
-   Baylor green square bullet points,
-   Roboto font default, and
-   Jetbrains mono font (no ligatures) for code blocks.

## Usage notes

### Note:

I'm working on making the template easily downloadable, for right now it is easiest to clone this repo and use the template as your presentation. Then get rid of all the extra files not needed.

-   To use the template in for a new document use the following code in the terminal.

```         
quarto use template nathenbyford/baylor-quarto-theme
```

-   To use the template on a preexisting quarto document and just add the theme you can use the following code in the terminal

```         
quarto add nathenbyford/baylor-quarto-theme
```
